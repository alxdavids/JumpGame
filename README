JumpGame
===============================================

The first repository I have added to Git Hub
-----------------------------------------------

This is the first project that I've properly worked on in my spare time. It's wrote in Java which is my strongest language at the moment and so I am weighing up moving onto a different langauge for my next project/ideas.

It hasn't taken too long to take shape although a lot of the code isn't very optimised (you can see a good example of this when you play the game and the speed increases). However I'm pleased with the results but less so with my attempts at artwork...
